The figures in Figure 3 mostly generated with online tools.

Figure 3A-B, we uploaded our group into cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org/), and compare the mutations in different MoSs.
Figure 3C, we assessed the impact of mutation to the mRNA expression of SETD2 via TIMER 2.0(http://timer.cistrome.org/).
Figure 3D, we evaluated the different overall survival of ccRCC patients with low or high SETD2 expression via GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/index.html), as well as Figure 3H.
Figure 3F and G were generated via Cytoscape software.
